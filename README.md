# Adafruit MacroPad Config
My personal setup of CircuitPython for the Adafruit MacroPad RP2040. This project is based on the [MacroPad Hotkeys guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-hotkeys/custom-configurations). I would highly recommend reading through that to learn how this works.

Things used in this project:
- [MacroPad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5100) - Required, links directly to purchase page with information.
- [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040) - The microcontroller used by the MacroPad and the target of this code.
- [Mu](https://codewith.mu/en/download) - Code editor with built in serial console if you want that sort of thing. Recommended by Adafruit.

This project assumes you know what you are doing, but on the off-chance you still haven't flashed CircuitPython, you can find out how to do so [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040/circuitpython). There is a copy of the UF2 file I used in this repo, it should be somewhere alongside this file in the root directory.
